# Dataset
### Drebin dataset:
We cannot share the data to honor the requirement of the data publisher. However, anyone can request the data from the Drebin data publisher to access the data. The dataset is available at **[[Drebin Dataset]](https://www.sec.tu-bs.de/~danarp/drebin/download.html)** .

### EMBER dataset:
EMBER dataset is public and ready to download from this **[[GitHub Repository]](https://github.com/elastic/ember)**. Please note that we use **2018** version of the data with **feature version 2**. For Domain-IL experiments, we process the data to have month-by-month train-test split from January 2018 to December 2018. For Task-IL and Class-IL, we process the data by malware families. EMBER dataset has 2900 malware families. We select top 100 families each with at least 400 samples.
