# **On the Limitations of Continual Learning for Malware Classification**

### **[Under Construction: We are currently working on cleaning the code to make that user friendly. If you want the code before the repository is updated, please email us, we will help you with our code and instruction.]**

This repository contains code and data of the paper **On the Limitations of Continual Learning for Malware Classification**, accepted at the First Conference on Lifelong Learning Agents (CoLLA). The code and dataset can be used to reproduce the results presented in the paper.

## Dependencies & Required Packages

Please make sure you have all the dependencies available and installed.

- NVIDIA GPU
- CentOS Linux 7 (Ubuntu should also work) 
- Python3-venv/ conda
- CUDA Version: 10.2 
- Python Version: 3.7.X

-- Please install the required packages using the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

We suggest the users to create a `python virtual environment` or `conda environment` and install the required packages.

```
conda create -n cl_malware python=3.7
conda activate cl_malware
conda install numpy=1.20.2
conda install pytorch=1.6.0 torchvision=0.7.0 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
```




# Dataset
### Drebin dataset:
We cannot share the data to honor the requirement of the data publisher. However, anyone can request the data from the Drebin data publisher to access the data. The dataset is available at **[[Drebin Dataset]](https://www.sec.tu-bs.de/~danarp/drebin/download.html)**. Please put the data into the ``drebin_data`` forlder after downloading. Afterwards, ``Drebin_Data_Process-CoLLAs-2022.py`` will generate the ``training`` and ``testing`` data for the top 18 families that can be used for the experiments of **Class-IL** and **Task-IL**. 

### EMBER dataset:
EMBER dataset is public and ready to download from this **[[GitHub Repository]](https://github.com/elastic/ember)**. Please note that we use **2018** version of the data with **feature version 2**. For Domain-IL experiments, we process the data to have month-by-month train-test split from January 2018 to December 2018. For Task-IL and Class-IL, we process the data by malware families. EMBER dataset has 2900 malware families. We select top 100 families each with at least 400 samples.
